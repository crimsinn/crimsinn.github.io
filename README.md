This is my final project for the GirlsWhoCode summer immmersion program. 
We chose different topics that we were passionate about to learn about and be activists for.
I chose Alzheimer's disease and, to a lesser extent, the topic of dementia in general.
The disease itself is horrible enough, yet people can feel ashamed and refuse help. No one deserves to go through Alzheimer's alone.
Caretakers, family, and friends can also be affected. It can be draining having a relative with Alzheimer's. Please don't be guilty. It's normal.

Anyways, I just wanted to make something that could maybe nudge someone to do a little something. 
It's nice to meet you. :)
